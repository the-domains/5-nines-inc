            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Apple Challenges Government Demand To Crack Drug Dealer's iPhone In New York</h1><p>Apple has formally challenged the U.S. Department of Justice over another locked iPhone and the encrypted information it contains. Owned by an accused methamphetamine distributor in Brooklyn, the iPhone 5s is believed to contain evidence of a drug conspiracy, investigators said.
